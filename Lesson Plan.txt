I would like to go over the first 2 sections in 30 mins but I think it might take a bit longer. 30 mins for the intro will leave 2 hours for modding which would be good. This is a low estimate and I think it will take roughly x2 as long to complete each section

Section 1: Playing the game ~ 15 mins
	1) Quick Demo of the game
	2) Let the kids play the tutorial
	3) Kids can play the campaign if they want

Section 2: IDE ~ 15 mins
	1) Brief explanation of the development environment
	2) Go over the project solution and the files
	3) Go over creating and editing files
	4) Go over adding files to the project (images, sounds, etc)
	5) Talk about the file system and where things are located
	
Section 3: Sprites and Animation ~ 30 mins
	1) Creating a new character
	2) Setting up a new character
	3) Add images to the project
	4) Changing character's sprite
	--- Optional ---
	5) Adding attack animations
	6) Adding idle animations
	7) Adding getting hit and blocking animations
	
Section 4: Modding Values ~ 30 mins
	1) Going over stats and what they do
	2) Messing with stats
	3) Talk about balancing stats
	
Section 5: Level ~ 30 mins
	1) Go over the level editor
	2) Showing how to mod levelsS
