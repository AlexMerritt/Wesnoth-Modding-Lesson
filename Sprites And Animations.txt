SPRITES AND ANIMATION

Required
1) Adding images to the project
2) Creating new units
3) Unit Attributes
4) Creating a new unit

---- Step 1: Adding a basic character sprite ----

	a) Right click on the units folder
	b) Click on new -> Wesnoth Config File (.cfg)
	c) A window will popup and you will want to rename the File name: from new_file.cfg to whatever you want to call it but make sure it ends in .cfg or else it will not work
	d) Go to the desktop and Wesnoth Module -> Resources -> open Unit Template
	e) Copy the entire contense of Unit Template into the unit you just made
	f) Give the unit an id (So anythign you want to call it, like fighter, mage, Charlie, ect) This is how we will refer to the unit in the code
	g) In the middle of the 2 " give it a name, this is what it will show up as in the game (_"Figher" , _"Mage", _"Charlie")
	h) go to scenarios -> scenario.cfg and open
	i) scroll down to where it says 
		[side]
			side=1
			controller=human
			team_name=2
			user_team_name= _ "Players Forces"
		
			type=Basic <---
			id=Campion
			name= _ "Fighter" <---
			canrecruit=yes
		
			recruit=Elvish Fighter,Elvish Archer,Horseman,Mage,Elvish Shaman
		
			gold=100
			income=10
		[/side]
		
		which is about 1/2 down
		
	j) Where it says type = ... change it so that the it equals the id of your unit
	k) Do the same for the name and the unit's name
			
	l) Run the game, load up the campaign and see if our unit shows up
	m) Drag you character's image into the folder images/units
	n) in the unit file find image = ... and change it to equal units/<you character's image name>
	
	now if you run it, you should see your character in the game
	
	optional - add a description to the unit 
	
	---- End of creating a new character ----

----This is what it should look like----
#textdomain wesnoth-units
[unit_type]
	id = Basic
	name = _"Basic"
	image = units/basic.png
	
	hp = 10
	movement = 5
	
	movement_type=woodlands
	description = _"This is the most basic of characters"
	
	[attack]
		name = sword
		description = _"sword"
		icon = weapons/sword.png
		type = blade
		attack = 5
		number = 1
	[/attack]
[/unit_type]

---- Step 2: Adding an animation ----

	add animation frames to the project
	
	a) We are going to start adding stuff after [/attack] but before [/unit_type]
	b) We need to add [attack_anim] and add [/attack_anim] on the next line
		---Comment: this is the start of an attack animation---
		[attack_anim]
		[/attack_anim]
		
	c) Next we need to say when to play the animation so we need to add an [filter_attack] section inside of the [attack_anim] and in the middle of the [filter_attack] block add a name = < the name of the attack > 
		[filter_attack]
			name=sword
		[/filter_attack]
		
	d) After the [/filter_attack] block we need to add a [frame] block
		[frame]
		[/frame]
		
	e) Inside of the [frame] block we need to add
		begin = when the animation starts
		end = when the animation ends
		image = the frame of the animation units/<unit attack frame>
		
	f) time reference scale 0 is when the damage is delt so you want to start your animations with a negative number and end with a positive number
	
	run the game and see if it works
	
	---- End of adding attack animations ----

----This is what it should look like----
[unit_type]
	id = Basic
	name = _"Basic"
	image = units/basic.png
	
	hitpoints = 2600
    movement = 50
    
    movement_type = woodland
    
    description= _ "Your most basic of units"
    
    [attack]
		name = sword
		description = _"Sword"
		icon = weapons/sword.png
		type = blade
		range = melee
		damage = 5
		number = 10
	[/attack]
	
	[attack_anim]
		[filter_attack]
			name=sword
		[/filter_attack]
		[frame]
    		begin=-75
    		end=25
    		image=units/basic-attack.png
    	[/frame]
    	[frame]
            begin=25
            end=75
            image=units/basic.png
        [/frame]
	[/attack_anim]
[/unit_type]
